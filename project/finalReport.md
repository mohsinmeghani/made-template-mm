# Data Report: Carbon Emission and Ocean Surface Acidity Analysis

## 1. Introduction
This report analyzes the relationship between average carbon emissions in Europe and ocean surface acidity from 2011 to 2022. The analysis includes visualizations, correlation, and covariance between the two variables.

## 2. Data Overview
- **Carbon Emission Dataset:** Contains the average carbon emissions in Europe over the years.
- **Ocean Surface Acidity Dataset:** Contains the ocean surface acidity levels over the same period.

  |                 | Carbon_Emission | Ocean_Acidity |
  |-----------------|-----------------|---------------|
  | Carbon_Emission | 1.000           | -0.938        |
  | Ocean_Acidity   | -0.938          | 1.000         |

- **Covariance between Carbon Emission and Ocean Acidity:** \(-0.0076\)

## 5. Conclusion
The analysis indicates a strong negative correlation (\( r = -0.938 \)) between carbon emissions and ocean acidity levels. The covariance value of \(-0.0076\) suggests that as carbon emissions increase, ocean surface acidity tends to decrease. This relationship highlights the potential impact of carbon emissions on oceanic conditions.
