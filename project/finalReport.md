# Analysis of the Correlation Between Global Mean Surface Seawater Acidity and Agricultural Greenhouse Gas Emissions

## 1. Introduction
The increasing acidity of global mean surface seawater, known as ocean acidification, is a critical environmental issue. It results primarily from the absorption of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO₂) by the oceans, forming carbonic acid. This process is influenced by various sources of CO₂ and other greenhouse gases, including emissions from agricultural activities. Understanding the correlation between agricultural greenhouse gas emissions and ocean acidification over the past two decades is essential for developing effective mitigation strategies.

## 2. Used Data
**Data Set 1: Global Mean Surface Seawater Acidity**
- **Source:** Eurostat
- **Description:** This dataset provides annual measurements of global mean surface seawater pH levels, reflecting trends in ocean acidity over time.

## 3. Analysis
**Methodology**
- **Data Cleaning and Transformation:** Removed unwanted data and applied appropriate data types. Aligned datasets to common time periods to resolve inconsistent timeframes.
- **Data Merging:** Created separate pipelines for each input dataset and saved data into a single SQLite database to facilitate normalization and querying.

**Results**
- **Trend Analysis:** Examined the trends in seawater acidity and agricultural greenhouse gas emissions over the past two decades.
- **Correlation Assessment:** Used statistical methods to assess the correlation between the two variables, focusing on the relationship between pH levels and emissions of CH₄ and N₂O.

**Interpretation**
- **Positive Correlation:** Found a positive correlation between increased agricultural greenhouse gas emissions and the rising acidity of seawater, indicating that emissions from agriculture contribute to ocean acidification.
- **Significance of Findings:** Highlighted the importance of reducing agricultural emissions to mitigate ocean acidification.

## 4. Conclusions
The analysis demonstrates a clear correlation between agricultural greenhouse gas emissions and the trend in global mean surface seawater acidity over the past two decades. This finding underscores the need for targeted strategies to reduce emissions from agricultural activities as part of broader efforts to combat ocean acidification. While the question has been answered comprehensively, further research is needed to explore the impacts of specific agricultural practices and regional variations on ocean acidity.
