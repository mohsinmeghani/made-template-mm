# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Impact of Farming Emission on Ocean Acidity.

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. How does the trend in global mean surface seawater acidity correlate with greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture over the last decade in Europe?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
This question explores the relationship between global mean surface seawater acidity and greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture over the past two decades. Seawater acidity, measured by pH levels, indicates the ocean's acidification, primarily driven by increased atmospheric CO2. Agricultural activities emit significant greenhouse gases like methane and nitrous oxide, contributing to climate change. By analyzing trends in these datasets, we aim to understand how agricultural emissions may be influencing ocean acidification and its broader environmental impacts. 

## Datasources

<!-- Describe each datasources you plan to use in a section. Use the prefic "DatasourceX" where X is the id of the datasource. -->

### Datasource 1: euorstat
* Metadata URL: [https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/metadata/en/sdg_14_50_esmsip2.htm  ]
* Data URL: [https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/sdg_14_50/default/table?lang=en&category=cli.cli_iad]
* Data Type: CSV

Short description of the DataSource.
This datasource shows the global ocean surface acidity expressed as mean pH value. The decline in pH observed on a global scale corresponds to an increase in the acidity of ocean water and vice versa.

### Datasource 2: euorstat
* Metadata URL: [https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/metadata/en/env_air_gge_esms.htm]
* Data URL: [https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/tai08/default/table?lang=en&category=cli.cli_gge]
* Data Type: CSV

Short description of the DataSource.
This datasource contains tracks trends in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by agriculture, estimated and reported under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Kyoto Protocol and the Decision.
